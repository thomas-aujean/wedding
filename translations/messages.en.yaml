accomodations: Accomodation
accomodations_1: We are envisioning a wedding weekend festival-vibe where our friends and family can camp in cabins, tents, or camping cars on-site, to carry-on the festivities with fellow guests and friends.
accomodations_2: A block of cabins have been reserved for out-of-town guests at <a href="https://harpersferryadventurecenter.com/adventures/cabins/" target="_blank">Harpers Ferry Adventure Center</a>. These cabins will be on-site, and therefore within walking distance of the wedding + reception. This will also be the meeting point for Saturday morning yoga, and Sunday’s activities:&nbsp;whitewater tubing and zip lining.
accomodations_3: There are six cabins which sleep four people each in a secluded wooded area, three minutes by foot to the wedding ceremony + reception. This area will also host the wedding afterparty. These are cabin numbers 1-6 on the <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#mapModal" style="cursor:pointer;">map</a>. They are $139/night.
accomodations_4: There are four larger cabins which sleep five people each, also within a three minute walk to the ceremony + reception. These cabins are close to the main office and bathhouse, and will be quieter in the after-hours. These are cabins 7-10 on the <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#mapModal" style="cursor:pointer;">map</a>. They are $149/night. <br> <br>We will provide sheets, pillows, blankets, and towels for all cabins.
accomodations_5: "For anyone considering renting an RV or camping car, you can park it at the <a data-bs-toggle=\"modal\" data-bs-target=\"#mapModal\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\">mountaintop campsite #6</a>, free of charge."
accomodations_6: "For more local guests who can bring their own tents and camping gear, we have booked the <a data-bs-toggle=\"modal\" data-bs-target=\"#mapModal\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\">mountaintop campsite #6</a> for you to camp at, free of charge. This campsite will be a short walk away from the ceremony and reception as well as being the site of the afterparty and breakfast buffet."
accomodations_7: Instructions for reserving a cabin at Harpers Ferry Adventure Center
accomodations_8: You will not find the cabins available on the website for these dates as they have already been blocked for our guests only. You must email Kim to reserve your cabin, at  info@hfadventurecenter.com
accomodations_8b: Be sure to mention in the email that your reservation is for the Aujean Alquist wedding, and specify which cabin size you would like (small:&nbsp;4 people, $139/night -or- large:&nbsp;5 people, $149/night). The cabins are on hold for our wedding guests <u>until March 30, 2025</u>. After that, they will be available to the public. So be sure to book before March 30th! They will send your invoice and link to pay online via email.
accomodations_9: We would recommend booking your cabin from Friday July 11 to Monday July 14, as we will be out on the river or zip lining through the mountains on Sunday morning! This way you will not have to rush to check-out at the same time we are getting ready for adventure! Check-out time for cabins and tents is at 11 am; whitewater tubing and ziplining is at 10:30 am on Sunday, July 13.
accomodations_10: "For those who prefer more modern luxuries, we have also reserved a block of hotel rooms at the Clarion Inn in Harpers Ferry, about a 5 minute drive from the wedding venue. From here, transportation will be provided to and from the wedding on July 12. <br>Please use this <a href=\"https://www.choicehotels.com/reservations/groups/TA99Y1\" target=\"_blank\">link</a> to reserve your room.
