accomodations: Accomodation
accomodations_1: We are envisioning a wedding weekend festival-vibe where our friends and family can camp in cabins, tents, or camping cars on-site, to carry-on the festivities with fellow guests and friends, without worrying about transportation.
accomodations_2: A block of cabins have been reserved for out-of-town guests at <a href="https://harpersferryadventurecenter.com/adventures/cabins/" target="_blank">Harpers Ferry Adventure Center</a>. These cabins will be on-site, and therefore within walking distance of the wedding + reception. This will also be the meeting point for Saturday morning yoga, and Sunday’s activities:&nbsp;whitewater tubing and zip lining.
accomodations_3: There are six cabins which sleep four people each in a secluded wooded area, three minutes by foot to the wedding ceremony + reception. This area will also host the wedding afterparty. These are cabin numbers 1-6 on the <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#mapModal" style="cursor:pointer;"><u>map</u></a>. They are $139/night.
accomodations_4: There are four larger cabins which sleep five people each, also within a three minute walk to the ceremony + reception. These cabins are close to the check-in and bathhouse, and will be quieter in the after-hours. These are cabins 7-10 on the <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#mapModal" style="cursor:pointer;"><u>map</u></a>. They are $149/night. <br> <br>We will provide sheets, pillows, blankets, and towels for all cabins.
accomodations_5: "For anyone considering renting an RV or a camping car, you can either park it at the mountaintop campsite #6, free of charge."
accomodations_6: "For more local guests who can bring their own tents and camping gear, we have booked the mountain top campsite #6 for you to camp at. This campsite will be a short walk away from cabins 1 and 2 (the site of the afterparty and breakfast buffet), as well as to the ceremony and reception."
